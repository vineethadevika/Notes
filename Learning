1.String Formatting:
String.format("%02d", variablename);
It formats the integer variablename with leading zeros to ensure it's at least two characters wide.
Example: int hour = 5; would indeed produce "05" when formatted using this string format.

2.Removing Characters from the End of a String:
String time = str[0].substring(0, 2);
This extracts the first two characters from the string str[0].
It's worth mentioning that this will take the first two characters regardless of what they are, not specifically removing characters from the end.

3.Formatting Floating Point Numbers:
System.out.format("%.6f", variablename);
It formats the floating-point number variablename with six decimal places.
Example: double ans = 5.0; would produce "5.000000" 

4.Accessing Values from a List:
listname.get(indexvalue);
This retrieves the value at the specified index in the list.
Example: listname.get(i); or listname.get(0); 

5.Sorting a List:
Collections.sort(listname);
It sorts the elements in the list in ascending order.
Example: Collections.sort(arr); 

6.Accessing 2D Array Values in a List of Lists in Java
A List<List<T>> in Java represents a 2D array, where T is the type of elements stored in the array. You can visualize it as a table with rows and columns, where each List<T> represents a row.
--Accessing Elements--
To access an element at row i and column j:
listName.get(i).get(j);
